EXERCISE 1

For ThreadTest(int n) with values 0 through 4 I was able to see that n=0,1 would return the same output due to the for loop that 
iterates from 1 to n and it also calls SimpleThread(0). For values 2-4 I saw that all threads go in order to increase their value to 5 
for every thread. I was surprised by this behavior as I was expecting the SharedVariable to be used across threads as we were only 
forking the function and supposed anything outside would be owned by the main process.

Using semaphores, I was able to see that now the SharedVariable would work as intended, being shared across all threads and being
incremented by one for every thread in order. With ThreadTest(4) the value would reach 20. However, by using the `-rs` option I was
able to see a much randomized and not synchronized order of operations by using random seed 123 as an example. After yielding until
all threads were done this problem would not occur anymore. The only variation is which thread prints that it saw the final value
which is expected.

EXERCISE 2

As described in the project description, locks are very similar to semaphores. It uses a queue in order to append in order
all threads that are awaiting to use a certain function and making them sleep, until the previous thread releases the lock
and wakes up the next thread to use the function.

The difference between the semaphore and lock is that a lock only accomodates one thread prior to locking (we use the variable free)
the semaphore on the other side, allows for n amount of threads to be inside the semaphore prior to making other threads in the queue 
sleep.
